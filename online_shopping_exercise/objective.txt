The objective of this exercise is to design models for an online shopping service, 
and to implement newly learned object-based design patterns that are particularly helpful for debugging.

A User should have an id and a name, and be able to sell_product, buy_product, and write_review.
A Product should contain a name, a description, a seller, a collection of reviews, a price, and an availability.
A Review should contain a description, a user (who wrote the review), and a product (for which the review is written)
Each of these classes should be nicely printable.

When complete, the following lines of code should be valid:

brianna = User(1, 'Brianna')
mary = User(2, 'Mary')

keyboard = brianna.sell_product('Keyboard', 'A nice mechanical keyboard', 100)
print(keyboard.available)  # => True
mary.buy_product(keyboard)
print(keyboard.available)  # => False
review = mary.write_review('This is the best keyboard ever!', keyboard)
review in mary.reviews  # => True
review in keyboard.reviews  # => True
